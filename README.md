# 📈 NIFTY-50 Market Intelligence: LSTM Deep Learning Forecast

This project implements a high-precision **Deep Learning** pipeline to forecast the daily closing price of the **NIFTY 50 Index**. Unlike traditional linear models, this system utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network architecture in **PyTorch** to capture non-linear dependencies and temporal patterns within Indian financial markets.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Real-time Data Pipeline:** Automated fetching of historical data directly from Yahoo Finance (`^NSEI`).
* **Recurrent Neural Architecture:** Custom-built LSTM class with multiple hidden layers for deep feature extraction.
* **Advanced Normalization:** Implements `MinMaxScaler` to ensure numerical stability during gradient descent.
* **Interactive Analytics:** A Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time training visualization and price forecasting.
* **Hyperparameter Tuned:** Optimized with the **Adam Optimizer** and **MSE Loss** for minimized forecasting error.

## 🧠 Technical Methodology

* **Architecture:** The model uses a 30-day "Sliding Window" approach. It analyzes the previous month's price action to predict the next single trading day.
* **Memory Gates:** The LSTM utilizes *Input*, *Forget*, and *Output* gates to selectively retain significant market trends while discarding "noise."
* **Optimization:** Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is used to refine the model's weights over 25 training epochs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** PyTorch (Deep Learning Engine)
* **Analytics:** Pandas, NumPy
* **API:** yfinance (Real-time Market Data)
* **UI:** Streamlit (Ground Station Dashboard)
* **Evaluation:** Scikit-learn (MSE, MAE Metrics)

## 📊 Accuracy & Evaluation

The model is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**. During training, the "Loss" represents the difference between the AI's prediction and the actual market closing price. A decreasing loss curve signifies that the model is effectively learning the NIFTY 50's volatility patterns.

### Tips for your Viva (Defense):

* **When asked about NIFTY:** Say, *"I used the ticker `^NSEI` which tracks the top 50 market-cap companies in India, making it a highly liquid and stable benchmark for AI training."*
* **When asked about the Model:** Say, *"I implemented a custom PyTorch class to gain full control over the hidden state transitions, which is more robust than a generic Keras wrapper."*
